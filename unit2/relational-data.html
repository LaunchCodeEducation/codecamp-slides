# Intro to Relational Data

---

## Relational Data

**Relational data** is an approach to data storage in which related entities are stored in **tables**

A specific relational database system is sometimes called a **relational database management system (RDBMS)**. Each RDBMS has it's a query language and it's own internal operations

**Example:**

SQL is a query language implemented by many database systems, including MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server

---

## Why Use RDBMS?

- Storing data outside our applications allows it to be accessible by multiple applicaitons
- Databases are better at managing data than programming languages (faster queries, specialized error handling, etc.)
- Using special libraries within our applications will allow us to **not care** which RDBMS we're actually using

---

## Tables

A **table** in an RDBMS is a structure for storing related data--e.g. all students in at a school, or all products in a store

Tables have **structures** that define the characteristics of the data that they can store

A **database** is a collection of related tables

---

## Table Structure

```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    first VARCHAR(80),
    last VARCHAR(80)
);
```

This creates a table with 3 **columns** of type `INTEGER`, `VARCHAR(80)`, `VARCHAR(80)`

---

## Common Data Types

- `VARCHAR` - strings of up to 255 characters (max length can be specified)
- `TEXT` - much longer strings of characters (over 65k letters)
- `INTEGER` - integers
- `DECIMAL` - floating-point numbers
- `BOOL` - Booleans (actually stored as 0 or 1)

---

## SQL Facts

- It is _not_ case-sensitive; by convention many people write SQL keywords in all-caps which can help readability
- All queries must end in a semi-colon `;`

---

## Query Review

- `SELECT`
- `INSERT`
- `WHERE`
- `ORDER BY`

---

## Keys

**Primary keys** are unique identifiers assigned to each row of a table. We can use `AUTOINCREMENT` when defining a table to ensure that a unique value is automatically assigned on insertion

A **foreign key** is a column value that corresponds to a primary key in another table. These define relationships within tables.

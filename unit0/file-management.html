# File Management
## Unit 0: Lesson 1

---

## Files and File Types

- A **file** is a piece of data stored on a computer
- Files generally have a *type*, which indicates how they are to be used
    - Examples: The `.docx` format is used for Microsoft Word files
- File types dictate the format of the data stored within the file
- The type of a file is indicated by an **extension**

???
Demo: xxd

Talk about how formats relate to file contents

---

## File Type/Extension Examples

File extensions make up the last portion of the file name, after a dot (`.`)

**Example:** `launchcode_log.jpg`

- Images: `.png`, `.jpg`, `.gif`
- Word Processing: `.docx`, `.pages`
- Executable files: `.exe`
- Plain text files: `.txt`
- Zip/archive files: `.zip`, `.tar`, `.gz`

Many file types require special programs to open them. Which programs might you use to open the file types above?

---

## Folders and the Filesystem

A **folder** is a named collection of files

Every file is in a folder, and every folder is itself in a folder, except for one special folder, called the **filesystem root** or **root folder**.

???
Analogy: Files and the filesystem -> manilla folder in filing cabinet

Describe filesystem as a tree

Note: Folders are files too!

---

## Navigating the Filesystem

There are many ways to navigate the filesystem:

- Via a special program: Explorer (Windows) or Finder (Mac)
- Via a terminal / shell / command-line interface
- Within programs (e.g. opening a file in a web browser, or MS Word)

???
Demo:
- Show each of these methods

---

## Special Folders

We'll refer to some folders more than others.

- Home
- Downloads
- Documents
- Trash / Recycle Bin

???
Demo: Find each of these in both Windows and Mac

Q: If the Trash is just a folder, what happens when we "delete" a file?

---

## Copying and Moving Files

We'll frequently want to move or copy files and folders. This can be done via the command-line, or via Finder or Windows Explorer.

To move or copy files via one of the file browser applications, do one of the following:
- Use the right-click menu
- Use keyboard shortcuts for copy/paste: cmd+C / ctrl+C (copy), cmd+V / ctrl+V (paste)

---

## Archive Files

An **archive file** is a special file type that allows lots of files and folders to be bundled up and moved easily.

The most common archive file type is that of a **ZIP file**.

???
Show zip file as containing

Demo: Zip up a folder, move it, unzip it

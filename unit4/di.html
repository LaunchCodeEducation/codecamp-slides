# Dependency Injection

---

## A CD Player App

Let's start with the following class, and build a class to "play" the CD

```java
public class SgtPeppers {
    private String title = "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band";
    private String artist = "The Beatles";

    public void play() {
        System.out.println("Playing " + title + " by " + artist);
    }
}
```

---

## Class Dependencies

A **dependency** of a class is any non-primitive instance variable of the class.

--

```java
public class CdPlayer {
    private SgtPeppers cd;

    public CdPlayer() {
        this.cd = new SgtPeppers();
    }

    public void play() {
        cd.play();
    }
}
```

--

`CdPlayer` depends on `SgtPeppers`

---

## Tight Coupling

In the previous example, we say that `CdPlayer` is **tightly coupled** to the `SgtPeppers` class, since it depends explicitely on the given class.

--

A less coupled version would be:

```java
public class CdPlayer {
    private SgtPeppers cd;

    public CdPlayer(SgtPeppers cd) {
        this.cd = cd;
    }

    public void play() {
        cd.play();
    }
}
```

---

## Loose Coupling

We can take this a step further by introducing an interface and reducing the dependency on the concrete class `SgtPeppers`

--

```java
public interface CompactDisc {
    public void play();
}

public class SgtPeppers implements CompactDisc {
    private String title = "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band";
    private String artist = "The Beatles";

    public void play() {
        System.out.println("Playing " + title + " by " + artist);
    }
}
```

---

## Loose Coupling via Contructors

The refactored `CdPlayer` looks like:

```java
public class CdPlayer {
    private CompactDisc cd;

    public CdPlayer(SgtPeppers cd) {
        this.cd = cd;
    }

    public void play() {
        cd.play();
    }
}
```

---

## The Program

We could now use these classes this way:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    CompactDisc cd = new SgtPeppers();
    MediaPlayer player = new CdPlayer(cd);
    player.play();
}
```

---

## Loose Coupling via Setters

We could also set up the `cd` field using a setter:

```java
public class CdPlayer {
    private CompactDisc cd;

    public void setCd(CompactDisc cd) {
        this.cd = cd;
    }

    public void play() {
        cd.play();
    }
}
```

---

## The Program

The the program looks like this:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    MediaPlayer player = new CdPlayer();
    player.setCd(new SgtPeppers());
    player.play();
}
```

--

But then _these_ programs are tightly-coupled to the `SgtPeppers` class

---

## Dependency Injection to the Rescue!

**Dependency injection (DI)** is a technique that allows application dependencies to be loosened and removed, and managed externally to the main application code.

--

It relies on external configuration (via XML or Java configuration classes), and a **container**.

--

The container then manages and satisfies dependencies of the application.

---

## DI with Spring

Spring provides a DI framework, including a container to manage dependencies

--

The container can manage objects and dependencies for us:

Objects managed by the container are referred to as **beans**

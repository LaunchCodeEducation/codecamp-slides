# Unit Testing

---

## Why Test?

- A strong set of tests allows for "safe refactoring"
--

- Identify bugs early in the development process
--

- It's easier to identify the cause of broken code
--

- Good tests make for a "self-documenting" application
--

- Used with test-driven development strategies, they enable productive, positive planning and coding

---

## What is a "unit"?

The answer depends on who you ask. Here are some answers from the Internet:

- An individual function
--

- An individual class
--

- An individual "module"
--

- The smallest testable unit of work

--

For now, we'll mostly avoid trying to provide a precise answer while we get a feel for unit testing. If you like, you can think of a "unit" as:

> _A single, clearly-stated, desired behavior_


---

## Test-Driven Development

- Unit testing is part of a larger development approach known as *test-driven development (TDD)*
--

- Unit testing _is not_ TDD in and of itself. Many use unit tests while not following strict TDD practices.
--

- Even if you don't use strict TDD, following the **red-green-refactor** motto is useful:

---

## What to Test

- "Sunny day" or "happy path" scenarios for your methods
--

- Edge cases and unexpected inputs: postive/negative/0, `null`, etc
--

- Validation
--

- Exceptions are thrown when desired

---

## What Not to Test

- Getters and setters (usually)
--

- 3rd-party code


---

## JUnit

JUnit is the most widely-used Java unit testing framework, and has been the inspiration for dozens of other unit testing frameworks since it was first developed in the late '90s.

---

## Unit Test Components

### Test

A single test method, annotated with `@Test`

--

### Fixture

A single class containing tests

--

### Test Runner

A library that runs tests and produces a report. For us, this is JUnit.

---

## Getting Ready to Test

In a Spring Boot project, you'll already have everything set up for you to create tests in `src/test/java`.

--

For a plain Java project, you can get started testing by:

--

1. Creating a `tests` folder at the top level of the project
1. Selecting _File > Project Structure > Modules_ and marking this folder as "Tests" or "Test Root" folder
1. Putting each test fixture in a well-named class (e.g. test for the class `Model` could go in `ModelTests`), which resides in the same package as the class being tested.

--

To run the tests, right-click on the `tests` folder and select _Run All Tests_

---

## Writing a Test

A single test is a public method annotated with `@Test` that returns `void`:

```java
public class ModelTests {

    @Test
    public void ensureSkyIsBlue() {
        // code to execute test
    }

}
```

---

## Assertions

Tests are built on the concept of **assertions**. An assertion is how we, as the programmer designing the test, state the expected outcome of an action.

--

```java
public class ModelTests {
    @Test
    public void ensureSkyIsBlue() {
        Sky sky = new Sky();
        assertEquals("blue", sky.getColor());
    }
}
```

--

The first value of an assertion is the **expected** value, while the second is the **actual** value

---

## Some JUnit Assertions

There are lots of types of assertions provided by JUnit. Here are a few:

- `assertEquals`
--

- `assertFalse` and `assertTrue`
--

- `assertNull` and `assertNotNull`
--

- `fail` - an "assertion" that always fails

---

## Negative Testing

At times we may want to test that an exception is thrown in a given situation, for example when validating values provided to a method or object. One way to do this is as follows:

--

```java
@Test
public void ensureValidationExceptionThrown() {
    try {
        // some code that we expect to throw an exception
        fail();
    } catch (SomeException e) {
        // do nothing
    }
}
```

---

## Better Negative Testing

JUnit provides a better way to do this:

```java
@Test(expected = SomeException.class)
public void ensureValidationExceptionThrown() {
    // some code that we expect to throw an exception
}
```

---

## Setting Up and Tearing Down

Within a test fixture, we can encapsulate repeated behavior needed for each test within methods annotated with `@Before` and `@After`:

```java
@Before
public void createInitialObjects() {
    // code to run before *each* individual test method
}
```

--

```java
@After
public void cleanupStuff() {
    // code to run before *after* individual test method
}
```

---

## Setting Up and Tearing Down

Some common tasks to put inside these methods:

- Create test object(s)
--

- Set up / close a database connection
--

- Read in settings, or other framework-specific initialization

---

## Notes on Setting Up and Tearing Down

_Note 1_: Historically, these methods had to be called `setUp` and `tearDown`, and while these terms are used to generally refer to them, it is no longer required in JUnit for you to use these names.

_Note 2_: Remember that these methods will run before and after _each_ test method. If you want behavior(s) to run before or after _all_ methods in the fixture, use `@BeforeClass` or `@AfterClass`. Most often, these latter annotations/methods are not really needed and should be avoided.

---

## Best Practices

- Avoid multiple assertions in a single test
--

- Keep code DRY by using `@Before` and `@After`
--

- Tests should be repeatable (e.g. avoid generating random test data)
--

- Tests should run quickly
--

- You should run your tests regularly, and only commit code with passing unit tests

---

## Other Types of Tests

### Integration Testing

Tests functionality that spans multiple units or modules.

**Example:** After submitting valid form data, a new entity is saved to the database and I receive a confirmation message.

--

### Functional Testing

Tests that the software meets all requirements, as specified by the client

--

### Performance Testing

Tests that the software performs as desired under realistic load and environmental situations

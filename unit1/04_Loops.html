# Loops and Turtles

---

## Repeating a task

Consider the following problem:

*Print out all of the integers from 1 to 100.*

One possible solution:

```python
print(1)
print(2)
print(3)
# … and so on
```

---

## This is bad!

- It’s tedious
- It’s error-prone
- If we want to make a relatively small change (e.g. to print only even numbers, or print up to 150) then we have to edit a LOT of code

---

## Loops and Iteration

![Iteration (What Is Code? screenshot)](images/repetition.png)

---

## Loop Components

In order to repeat a task, we need two things:

1. The task that should be repeated (e.g. "print a number")
2. The data set that should be used with the task (e.g. "use 1...100")

---

## Lists

A **list** in Python is a data structure that allows us to collect several values in a single variable or value.

Lists look like this:

```python
[value1, value2, value3,…, valueN]
```

---

## List Examples

```python
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
[“apple”, “orange”, “banana”]
[36, True, “eggs”, 2.7]
```

---

## Lists As Types and Values

We can store a list in a variable:

```python
retired_nums = [1, 2, 6, 9, 10, 14, 17, 20, 24, 42]
```

Lists define a new data type:

```python
print(type(retired_nums))
```

Output:
```nohighlight
<type 'list'>
```

---

## For Loops

A `for` loop allows us to repeat a section of code a **specific number of times**

Each `for` loop has an **iterator variable** that changes its value every time the code section is repeated

## Loop Flow

The Unit 1 book has a tool called Code Lens that let's us visualize the flow of loops.

[Demo](https://runestone.launchcode.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/PythonTurtle/FlowofExecutionoftheforLoop.html)

---

## For Loop Examples

Let's code loops that:

- print a list of numbers; add them up
- Greet a list of individuals

---

## Repeating a task

Consider the following problem:

*Print out all of the integers from 1 to 100.*

One possible solution:

```python
print(1)
print(2)
print(3)
# … and so on
```

---

## The range Function

The function `range(n)` will create a list of `n` integers from `0` to `n-1`
```python
print(range(5))
```

Output: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`

Example: Let's print even numbers from 0 to 50, inclusive

---

## Using the range Function

To create more custom/complicated lists, use:

```python
range(start, stop, step)
```

- `start` - the first number in the list
- `stop` - one more than the last number in the list
- `step` - how much to increment each time

---

## Turtles

We'll use a Python **module** called `turtle` that will give us a nice way to build simple images using loops

```python
import turtle
zach = turtle.Turtle()
zach.forward(150)
zach.left(90)
zach.forward(75)
```

---

## Step-by-step

- `import turtle` - Makes the `turtle` module available within our program
- `zach = turtle.Turtle()` - Creates a new turtle **object** and stores it in the variable named `zach`
- `zach.forward(150)` - Move `zach` forward by 150 units
- `zach.left(90)` - Move `zach` left by 90 degrees
- zach.forward(75) - Move `zach` forward by 75 units

## Using Turtles Within Loops

**Exercise**

Draw a square using a turtle

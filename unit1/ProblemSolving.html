# Problem Solving

---

## The Fox, the Chicken, and the Corn

A farmer is on his way to market with a fox, a chicken, and a bag of corn. He must cross a river to get there. On the bank of the river is a boat that is big enough only for the farmer and one additional item, so he must take the three across one at a time.

--

1. If the farmer takes the fox first, the chicken will eat the corn.
1. If the farmer takes the corn first, the fox will eat the chicken.

How can the farmer get all three across unharmed?

## What steps did you take?

- Paid attention to implicit information
- Writing things down
- Asked questions
- Thinking through different possibilities

## Problem Solving: An Analogy

Problem solving is less like this:

## Problem Solving _Is_

- Intuitive
--

- Creative
--

- Practiceable
--

- Synthetic (requires putting together ideas from disparate places)
--

- Hard
--

- Rewarding
--

- A process

---

## Problem Solving _Is Not_

- Formulaic
--

- Repetetive
--

- Easy
--

---

## Principles of Problem Solving

Each problem is different, and will challenge us in different ways. There is no way to make problem solving routine!

--

However, there some "meta strategies" that we can use to guide our processes.

---

## Principle #1

---

## Don't Panic

Some common initial reactions to a hard problem:

--

_What if I can't figure this out?_

--

_I'm not smart enough to figure this out!_

--

_Somebody else in class is going to figure this out before me, because I'm not as smart._

--

_If I can't do this, my teacher/TA/classmates will know that I don't really understand things!_

--

## The Blerch / Demon of Doubt

Don't let the Blerch tell you that you can't do something

---

## Principle #2

### Restate the problem

Say the problem again in your own words to:

- Yourself, in your head
- Yourself, in writing
- A classmate, teacher, or friend

--

**You don't really understand something until you can teach it to somebody else.**

---

## Principle #3

### Outline the problem

- Write down what you know

--

- Try to subdivide the problem

???

**Write down what you know.** Given the problem statement, what facts do you have at-hand? Are there any basic inferences that you can make from the given facts?

**Subdivide the problem.** Are there any subtasks or subproblems that will need to be carried out or solved in order to reach the final solution? Write these down. This shouldn't be an exhaustive list of every step, or every line of code, but it should contain a level of detail beyond the problem statement itself.

---

## Principle #4

### Reduce the problem

---

## Example

**Problem:** Write a function that takes a list of integers, and returns the largest integer in the list.

--

**Reduced Problem:** Write a function that takes a list with exactly two integers, and returns the larger of the two.

---

## Example

**Problem:** Write a program that makes an image darker.

--

**Reduced Problem 1:** Write a program that makes a pixel-by-pixel copy of an image

**Reduced Problem 2:** Write a program that makes a single pixel darker.

---

## Principle #5

### Look for similarities

Have you solved a problem that has some similarities to the one at-hand?

--

How the two problems the same?

--

How are the two problems different?

---

## Principle #6

---

## Team Problem: Apples and Oranges

You have three boxes that contain some combination of apples and oranges:

- One has only apples
- One has only oranges
- One has both apples and oranges

--

The boxes have lables signifying each of the three, but _each box is mislabled_.

--

You may ask for one item from one of the boxes to be shown to you. This item will be randomly pulled from the box.

--

How can you figure out the correct labeling of the boxes?

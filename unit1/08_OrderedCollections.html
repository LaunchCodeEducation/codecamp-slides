# Ordered Collections: Lists and Strings

---

## Primitive Data Types

Some of the data types that we've seen can't be "broken down" into smaller pieces

This is true of `int`, `float`, and `bool`. We call these **primitive data types**.

### Question

What about `str` and `list`? Can these be broken down into smaller pieces?

---

## Non-primitive Types

Lists and strings are inherently composed of smaller pieces

### Example: List components

A list like `[1, 2, 3]` contains the individual integer values `1`, `2`, and `3`

### Example: String components

A string like `'LaunchCode'` contains the invidual **characters** `L`, `a`, `u`, etc.

Strings and lists are examples of **collection data types**

---

## Characters

- We'll refer to a string of length 1 as a **character**
- Many programming languages have their own character data type, but Python does not

---

## Empty Collections

We can have a collection without any items in the collection

```python
empty_list = []
empty_string = ''
```

These are still considered collections, and are often referred to as the **empty list** and the **empty string**

---

## List and String Indexes

Lists and strings are **ordered collections** in that the items within them have a specific order. We refer to the place of an individual item in that order as it's **index**.

For lists and strings, we may access the individual components using the index of that item.

## Counting Like a Computer Scientist

Note that the *first* item has index 0, and that for a list or string of length `n`, the last item is at index `n-1`

---

## Bracket Notation

Python provides an easy way to get an individual item out of a list or string using **bracket notation**

For a list `my_list` we can get the item with index `i` using: `my_list[i]`

```python
message = 'Hello'
print(message[1])
```

**Output:** `e`

---

## Examples

```python
states = ['MO', 'IL', 'KS']
first_state = states[0]
print(first_state)
```

**Output:** `MO`

---

## Examples

```python
state = 'Missouri'
first_char = state[0]
print(first_char)
```

**Output:** `M`

---

## Negative Indexes

We can also use a negative index with the bracket operator

```python
state = 'Missouri'
last_char = state[-1]
first_char = state[-8]
```

---

## The len Function

The `len` function takes a string or list argument and returns the number of items in that collection

```python
alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
number_of_letters = len(alphabet)
print(number_of_letters)
```
**Output:** `26`

```python
stooges = ['Larry', 'Moe', 'Curly']
number_of_stooges = len(stooges)
print(number_of_stooges)
```

**Output:** `3`

---

## When We Don't Know the Length...

```python
user_str = input("Enter a string: ")
print('Your string has', len(user_str), 'characters')
```

---

## Looping with Collections

We can loop over strings the same way that we loop over lists

```python
for letter in 'LaunchCode':
    print(letter)
```

**Output:**
```nohighlight
L
a
u
n
...
```

---

## Looping with Collections

It's possible to set up a different type of `for` loop that combines use of `range`, `len`, and list indexes

```python
alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'

for i in range(len(alphabet)):
    print(alphabet[i])
```

**Output:**

```nohighlight
a
b
c
d
...
```

---

## Strings As Lists of Characters

We'll sometimes say that "strings are lists"

This is **true** in the sense that the operations of looping and using bracket notation are the same for lists as for strings

This is not *entirely* true though. Why?

**Hint:** What happens when I try to do this:

```python
name = "Chris"
name[0] = 1
```

# WHY?

---

## Here's Why, Part 1

Using bracket notation is more cumbersome than iterating over a list. Which of these examples looks better?

```python
alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'

for i in range(len(alphabet)):
    print(alphabet[i])
```

```python
alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'

for letter in alphabet:
    print(letter)
```
---

## Here's Why, Part 2

Iterating over the collection directly allows us to name the iterator for the collection in a way that adds meaning/semantics

```python
alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'

for i in range(len(alphabet)):
    print(alphabet[i])
```

```python
alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'

for letter in alphabet:
    print(letter)
```

---

## Here's Why, Part 3

```python
first_name = "George"
last_name = "Washington"

# print out the last name, one char at a time
for i in range(len(first_name)):
    print(last_name[i])
```

What happens when we run this?

---

## But Maybe Sometimes You Can Do It

In specific cases, you might need to use `range`, `len`, and indexes when looping over a string. Some specific examples:

1. Reversing a string
2. Printing every other character from a string

---

## Exercise, Part 1

Write a program that:

1. Prompt the user for a string
2. Loop over the string, printing each letter on a different line

---

## Exercise, Part 1

```python
user_str = input("Enter a string: ")

for char in user_str:
    print(char)
```

---

## Exercise, Part 2

Modify your program so that it prints each letter on the same line. In other words, within the loop, build up a new string that has the same letters as the string input by the user.

---

## Exercise, Part 2

```python
user_str = input("Enter a string: ")
new_str = ''

for char in user_str:
    new_str = new_str + char

print(new_str)
```

---

## Exercise, Part 3

Modify your program so that it prints out the same string that the user entered, but with all lowercase 'a' characters removed.

---

## Exercise, Part 3

```python
user_str = input("Enter a string: ")
new_str = ''

for char in user_str:
    if char != 'a':
        new_str = new_str + char

print(new_str)
```

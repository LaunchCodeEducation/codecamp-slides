# A brief introduction to functions

---

## Using Functions

We've used some built-in functions already:

- `print`
- `input`
- `range`

Each of these carried out a specific task.

Let's review the mechanics of using functions...

---

## Function Usage

Each function that we have used has taken one or more *parameters*.

```python
print("Hello world")
name = input("What's your name")
some_numbers = range(1, 15, 2)
```

In these three examples, the parameters are:

- `"Hello world"`
- `"What's your name?"`
- `range(1, 15, 2)`

**Definition:** A **function parameter** (or just **parameter**) is a value that somebody using our function will provide.

---

## Functions That Return Values

Of the functions that we've used, `input` and `range` result in a value being given back to us. This value is known as a **return value**.

```python
name = input("What's your name")
some_numbers = range(1, 15, 2)
```

We can think of the return value of a function as being "substituted" for the function call when the program is run.

---

## Defining a Function

We can define our own functions with the following syntax:

```python
def my_function( parameters ):
    # function code, with our with out a return value
```

We can call the functions we define the same way that we call other functions.

---

## Hello, world function

```python
def hello_world():
    return "Hello world"

message = hello_world()
print(message)
```

Output: `Hello world`

---
## Hello, world function with parameter


```python
def hello_world(name):
    return "Hello " + name

message = hello_world("Sally")
print(message)
```

Output: `Hello Sally`

---

# Modules

---

## What is a module?

A **Python module** is a collection of Python code that is bundled up for others to use, but which is *not* part of the core Python programming language.

To use modules, we must *install* and then *import* them.

---

## Modules in Activecode / Runestone

Within the editors in the online textbook, the only modules available are:

- `turtle`
- `math`
- `random`

**It is not possible for you to install or import additional modules in these editors.**

---

## Modules in "Real" Coding Environments

Installing a module requires a program like `pip` or `conda`. We'll use both in this class.

In fact, you already have!

```
$ conda install pytest
```

```
$ pip install pytest-html
```

These different tools will isntall and manage module on your computer in different ways. Each has an online repository of modules that are available to install with the given tool.

---

## Package Repositories

### Pip

`pip` installs packages from the Python Package Index, viewable at [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/)

### Conda

`conda` installs packages from the Anaconda repository, viewable at [anaconda.org](https://anaconda.org/)

---

## Using Modules

For a module that is available, it can be used within a program by **importing** the module.

```python
import math
```

The **identifier** `math` is now available for us to use within our file.

```python
print(math.pi)
```

Output: `3.141592653589793`

---

## The math module

This module provides math-related utilities. Here are a few:

- Constants like `math.pi` and `math.e`
- Command mathematical functions like `math.sqrt` and `math.sin`
- Lots more documented at [docs.python.org](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html#module-math)

---

## The random module

This module provides utility functions for generating "random" numbers

- `random.random()` - returns a random float between 0 and 1
- `random.randrange(n, m)` - returns a random integer between `n` and `m-1`

*Note:* When computer scientists say "random number" they usually mean a *pseudo-random** number. An algorithm can't generate *truly* random numbers.

---

## The Python REPL

We can run Python within a terminal:

```
$ python
Python 3.6.0 |Continuum Analytics, Inc.| (default, Dec 23 2016, 13:19:00)
[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 6.0 (clang-600.0.57)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```

The `>>>` is a **python prompt**

---

## The Python REPL

### Fun Fact

REPL stands for **R**ead **Evaluate** **P**rint **L**oop, which describes how this prompt works.

Lots of programming languages have REPLs, and they're great for trying things out!

# Functions

---

## What Is a Function?

### Definition

A **function** is a named sequence of statements that carry out a specific task.

---

## Defining a Function

We can define our own functions with the following syntax:

```python
def my_function( parameters ):
    # function code, with our without a return value
```

Here's a specific example:

```python
def hello_world(name):
    return "Hello " + name
```

---

## Using a Function

We can use the functions we define the same way that we use other functions.

```python
message = hello_world("Sally")
```

When we use a function, we can also say that we are **calling** function, or that the line of code has a **function call**

---

## Return value of a Function

A function may contain a **return statement**, which can pass a value back to the code that called the function.


```python
def hello_world(name):
    return "Hello " + name

message = hello_world("Sally")
```

---

## Visualizing a function

![Visualizing a function](images/function.png)

---

## An Example

```python
import turtle

def draw_square(a_turtle, size):
    for i in range(4):
        a_turtle.forward(size)
        a_turtle.left(90)

speedy = turtle.Turtle()
draw_square(speedy, 50)
```

## Activity

### Step 1



Write a function called `add_two` that takes a number and prints the result of adding 2 to the input parameter. Run your program.

**Question**: Does the code within a function run when we define a function?

---


## Activity

### Step 2

Modify `add_two` so that it returns the result instead of printing. Call the function.

**Question:** If a function returns a value and we don't store it in a variable, what happens to the return value?

---


## Activity

### Step 3

Add a line of code within the function body, but after the return statement:

```python
print("after return")
```

**Question**: When our function runs, does this line of code execute?

---

## Some More Questions

In your `~/lc101/codecamp-notes/README.md` file, answer the following questions:

1. Does a function have to have parameters?
1. What happens if we call a function without providing a value for one or more input parameters?
1. Does a function have to return a value?
1. What happens if we have a function that doesn't return a value, but we try to store a return value in a variable?

---

## Some Answers

1. Does a function have to have parameters? No. A function may have 0 or more parameters, as decided by the programmer.
1. What happens if we call a function without providing a value for one or more input parameters? We get a `TypeError` unless there are default values provided.
1. Does a function have to return a value? NOPE
1. What happens if we have a function that doesn't return a value, but we try to store a return value in a variable? The value that is implicitely returned and stored is the **special value** `None`

---

## Scope

All variables and parameters within a program have a **scope**. Their scope determines how they may be accessed and used.

**Example**:

```python
def add_two(num):
    num = num + 2

add_two(2)
print(num)
```

---

## Local Scope

Variables and parameters within a function have **local scope**. They may only be accessed within the function in which they are defined.

We call such variables **local variables**

```python
def add_two(num):
    result = num + 2
    return result
```

`result` is a local variable

---

## Global Scope

Variables and parameters that *are not* defined within a function have **global scope**. They may be accessed from anywhere within the given file or program.

```python
num = 2

def print_num():
    print(num)

print_num()
```

The variable `num` has global scope, so it can be "seen" within `print_num`

---

## Shadowing

What happens when we use the same name for a global variable and a local variable?

```python
num = 2

def print_num(num):
    print(num)

print_num(3)
```

---

## Shadowing

In such cases, the local variable or paremeter will be used. We say that this local variable or parameter **shadows** the global variable.

```python
num = 2

def print_num(num):
    print(num)

print_num(3)
```

---

## Using a main Function

In general, we want to avoid cluttering up our programs with global code. We can avoid doing so by putting any such global code within a `main` function, and then calling the `main` function

```python
def hello(name):
    return "Hello " + name

def main():
    message = hello("Jenny")
    print(message)

main()
```

---

## Using a main Block

A better way to do this in Python involves the special variable `__name__`

```python
def hello(name):
    return "Hello " + name

if __name__ == '__main__':
    message = hello("Jenny")
    print(message)
```

We'll often refer to this as a **main block**

---

## Writing Cleaner Code

You should begin thing about the programs you write as having two components:

### Functions

For a given problem that you're solving, write the code within a function to make it more reusable and self-contained.

### Test Code

Put your test code within a main block.
